So you came here to install and use this (not) beautiful tool 

## 1. Method: Clone the repository
Just run 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tirito6626/bash2json
```

and make the file executable
```
chmod +x ./bash2json/bash2json
```

And now you can use
```bash
./bash2json/bash2json --version
```

### 2. Method: Download the file directly

Download the file
```
wget https://repo.tirito.de/projects/bash2json
```

and make the file executable

chmod +x ./bash2json/bash2json
```

done!
